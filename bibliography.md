	abstract = {The digital humanities has taken a spatial turn with the proliferation of web‐ and GPS‐enabled devices, the simplification of the technical software required to make maps, and the wide availability of historical imagery and geographic datasets. This chapter begins by exploring the governmental and military origins of geographic information systems (GIS) before turning to the emergence of “geohumanities,” a differentiated field that builds on and variously repurposes GIS technologies though humanistic methods and content. From reconstructions of ancient building sites to platforms for overlaying maps that tell competing narratives, geohumanities has challenged many assumptions and limits of spatial technologies through the qualitative, historical, and interpretative methods of the humanities. Through processes of thick mapping and counter‐mapping, the spatial turn in the digital humanities has also given rise to a broader scholarly reconceptualization of the significance of place in relationship to narrative, practices of representation, and digital technologies.},

Ideally GIS enables humanities scholars to discover relationships of memory, artifact, and experience that exist in a particular place and across time. Although successfully used by other disciplines, efforts by humanists to apply GIS and the spatial analytic method in their studies have been limited and halting.

	abstract = {This chapter discusses the perceived opposition in digital humanities scholarship between making and theorizing, often encapsulated by the phrase “more hack less yack.” Proponents of technically driven digital humanities insist that we must be builders, and that digital humanities students must learn to program, code, and create digital resources. Those more interested in theory, most notoriously Stanley Fish, object that digital humanities is crudely positivist, under‐theorized, and insufficiently self‐critical, and does not address questions for example of representation of race, gender, and sexuality, nor engage with cultural criticism. This chapter examines details of the debate and discusses whether the two sides can, or should, be reconciled. It examines earlier discussions about theory and method in English studies and history, as they grew into mature disciplines, and asks what digital humanities can learn from the development of these two fields, as it seeks to shape its own future.},

By investigating some of the ways Shakespeare has been reinvented and deployed, the study notes the differences between standard western approaches and those that can be seen in Japan, China, India, and South East Asia. The contributors come from a wide variety of backgrounds and traditions, West and East, and present distinctive, and sometimes conflicting, views on topics as diverse as speaking Shakespeare in Japanese, the importation and exportation of Shakespeare in Asia, and the uses of the English national poet in Indian film and Japanese popular culture. The debates which occur within the book highlight the diversity of production and reception for the world's most popular playwright, whose work is now global cultural capital"--Provided by publisher. , "The aim of this collection is to expand theoretical and functional discussion about the condition and significance of Shakespeare performance in contemporary Asia. As we explain in the introduction, we do not pretend to a comprehensive view of the topic, or allot an equivalent number of essays to competing regions, or suggest that our examples are necessarily representative of national or international trends. Any such approaches would distort the topic, given the size of Asia and the diversity of approaches to Shakespeare and performance found there. Instead we have tried to focus attention on why Shakespeare has been of use in an area of the world that has no inherent reason to call on him, investigating some of the ways his work has been reinvented and deployed"--Provided by publisher.},
