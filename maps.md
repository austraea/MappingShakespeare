### <span style="color: indianred;">Reception of Shakespeare in Asia</span>

Shakespeare's plays began to be accepted, translated, read, and performed in Asia, in Japan (1885), China (1913), and Korea (1925). The different routes for each country's reception of Shakespeare are associated with each of their historical, social, and political circumstances, especially, the modernization movements and the rise of colonialism in Asian region. The map presented below shows how Shakespeare's works were introduced and accepted to each Asian country and the international relationships between not only Britain and Asian countries but also between/among Asian countries.

Japan was the first Asian country to accept Shakespeare in the nineteenth century. Shakespeare was firstly mentioned in a Dutch translation of an English grammar book in 1841 and introduced in 1868 as one of threads for modernization movements during Meiji period (1868-1912). Shakespeare's plays were performed in front of public audiences in 1866 and 1869 through a form of public reading in Yokohama, one of the port cities in Japan, where the excerpt from *A Midsummer Night's Dream* and *Romeo and Juliet* were read. Later, a scene from The *Taming of the Shrew* was performed in English in the Gaiety Theatre in Yokohama in 1879.

As the map shows, Japan's reception of Shakespeare brought about not only cultural revolution and westernization in Japanese society but also impacted other Asian countries under Japan's colonialist movement. In 1903, *Othello* was performed as the outpost of the colonial Japanese empire in Taiwan, and *Hamlet* was performed in Korea by a Japanese theatre company in 1909. This shows Japan's role as a cultural agency and its political status in Asia. Japan, once a geographically marginalized and politically turbulent country in Asia, established one powerful authority and became politically and culturally powerful country enough to reintroduce what it had accepted to its near countries.

Shakespeare was mentioned earlier in China, during Opium Wars (1839-42), in Lin Zexu's *Annals of the Four Continent* and introduced into Hong Kong's school curriculum in 1882. First Chinsese-language performance of Shakespeare took place in Shanghai Eastern Girl's Highschool where *Woman Lawyer*, adaptation of *The Merchant of Venice* was staged in 1913. From 1927, cinematic Shakespearean adaptations, *The Woman Lawyer* (*Merchant of Venice*) and *A Spray of Plum Blossom* (*The Two Gentlemen from Verona*), were produced. 

The introduction of Shakespeare in Korea began along with the Japan-Korea annexation and Japanese domination over Korean peninsular. While the first Korean-language production of Shakespeare, *Julius Caesar* was performed in 1925, under Japanese colonization, Shakespeare's works rarely performed compared to the former two countries. However, Korea becomes the place with prolific "Koreanized" Shakespearean adaptations in the stage-play and film modes.
