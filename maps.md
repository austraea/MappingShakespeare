### <span style="color: indianred;">Reception of Shakespeare in Asia</span>

Shakespeare's plays began to be accepted, translated, read, and performed in Asia, in Japan (), Korea (), and China (). The different routes for each country's reception of Shakespeare are associated with each of their historical, social, and political circumstances, especially, the rise of colonialism in Asian region. The map presented below shows how Shakespeare's works were imported and accepted to each Asian country and the international relationships between not only Britain and Asian countries but also between/among Asian countries.

#### <span style="color: indianred;">Shakespeare in Japan and its colonies</span>

Japan was the first Asian country to accept Shakespeare in the nineteenth century. Shakespeare was firstly mentioned in a Dutch translation of an English grammar book in 1841. In Japan, Shakespeare's plays were accepted for its westernization movement, and linguistic and cultural reform during Meiji Restoration. Shakespeare's plays were introduced and performed in front of public audiences in 1866 and 1869 through a form of public reading in Yokohama, one of the port cities in Japan, where the excerpt from *A Midsummer Night's Dream* and *Romeo and Juliet* were read. Later, a scene from The *Taming of the Shrew* was performed in English in the Gaiety Theatre in Yokohama in 1879.

Japan's reception of Shakespeare brought about not only cultural revolution and westernization in Japanese society but also impacted other Asian countries under Japan's colonialist movement. In 1903, *Othello* was performed as the outpost of the colonial Japanese empire in Taiwan, and *Hamlet* was performed in Korea by a Japanese theatre company in 1909.
